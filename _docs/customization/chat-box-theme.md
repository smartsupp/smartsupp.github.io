## Offline form

This theme options `offlineHeight` is design just for offline form to be able to fit custom fields defined by user.

### offlineHeight

By default offline form is not high enough to fit extra fields unless you want to see scrollbar.

```js
<script>
  smartsupp('theme:options', {
    offlineHeight: 475
  });
</script>
```

Example is explained in **Customization** section [Offline form with textinput](/docs/customization/offline-form/#offline-form-with-textinput).
{: .callout .callout-info }


## Colors and variables names

Colors are generated automatically to match Smartsupp default theme. Change them when you need to customize chat box to match your company brand colors for example.

**Color syntax:** Format must be full hex pairs `#ff0000` and not `#f00` shorthand.

### Single color

You can set a specific color to your chat box.

```js
<script>
  smartsupp('theme:color', '#ff0000');
</script>
```

### Multiple colors

You can also set colors to multiple elements of the chat box.

```js
<script>
  smartsupp('theme:colors', { 
    primary:'#ff0000',
    banner:'#333333'
  });
</script>
```
